# HouseplantMonitor
An Arduino-powered device that assists users in taking care of a houseplant by monitoring soil moisture, predicting how much time is needed
before a plant must be watered again, and reminding users to water their plant by sounding an alarm at a specified moisture level.

Utilized an Arduino microcontroller, LCD screen to display the information and menus, water conductivity sensor to measure soil
moisture, and other electronic components such as tactile buttons, resistors, and a buzzer to play sounds.

Users can change the alarm threshold parameter, among other details, in the settings menu.

# Materials
Materials needed to construct this project are as follows:

* 3X 10k Ohm resistors (for pull up button configuration)
* 3X Tactile buttons
* 1X 16 Column / 2 Row LCD screen
* 1X Water conductivity sensor
* 1X Passive buzzer
* 1X Arduino Uno or equivalent
* 1X Full sized breadboard
* A series of male to male breadboard jumper wires
* 3+ Female to male extender cables for water sensor (Optional)
